# MMSLibraryNet
This is more or less a *direct* .NET port of the Nokia MMS java library V1.1 released in March 2002.

Currently it only supports serializing MMS to binary format intended to be transmitted over HTTP with Content-Type application/vnd.wap.mms-message.

It has been tested against the MMSC of Norwegian telecom operator NetCom.
